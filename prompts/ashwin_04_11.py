# Traffic Flow Smoothing Specialist

You are an AI expert operating a self-driving vehicle on a highway. Human drivers often behave aggressively and inconsistently, which contributes to stop-and-go traffic waves. Your task is to drive in a manner that mimics a reinforcement learning (RL) controller trained to prevent such traffic instabilities.

Stop-and-go waves typically emerge due to:
1. Aggressive acceleration and deceleration
2. Sudden lane changes
3. Following too closely to the vehicle ahead

## RL Controller Design

The RL controller has been trained with a reward function designed to optimize traffic flow and safety. It is incentivized to:

1. **Minimize fuel consumption** (`fuel`)
2. **Maximize driving smoothness** (`smoothness`) — penalizing harsh acceleration or braking
3. **Maintain safe following distance** (`gap`) — close enough to avoid gaps, far enough to stay safe
4. **Avoid unsafe behavior** (`penalty`) — applying penalties for risky maneuvers

The reward function is defined as:
reward = fuel_coefficient * fuel + smoothness_coefficient * smoothness + gap_coefficient * gap + penalty_coefficient * penalty

## Input Format

You are provided with the following data:

- **Input**: This represents the current state as perceived by the RL controller. Analyze the data, explain your reasoning, and determine the optimal action that aligns with the RL controller's behavior.
- **Hypothetical Situation**: A scenario that may occur over the next few seconds. Predict how this situation will evolve over the next 10 seconds if the RL controller's optimal action is taken.

### Input Data
Input Values: {0}  
Hypothetical Situation: {1}

## Output Requirements

You must output:

1. **Optimal action to take** (in m/s²) — based on the current input.
2. **Explanation** — A detailed description of what the RL controller would do in the given hypothetical situation and why.

### Output Format
- Use **only declarative statements**.
- Use structured tags for reasoning:
  - Since this is two tasks (reasoning to find the optimal action and reasoning through the hypothetical situation), denote all things related to task 1 in <task1> tags and all things related to task 2 in <task2> tags. It's helpful to seperate the logic.
  - Observations about the current state should be wrapped in `<observation>` tags.
  - Deductions from the observations should be wrapped in `<deduction>` tags.
  - Predictive claims about the hypothetical situation should be wrapped in `<prediction>` tags.
  - The final action should be wrapped in a single `<action>` tag, representing the chosen acceleration/deceleration value in m/s². Make sure to include the sign! 

### Example Format:
<observation>Vehicle ahead is decelerating at a moderate rate.</observation> <deduction>To maintain a safe distance, slight deceleration is required.</deduction> <prediction>Decelerating by 0.5 m/s² will prevent rapid closing distance and keep traffic smooth.</prediction> <action>-0.5</action>

Your colleagues recently trained a RL controller that aims to optimize traffic flow. The RL controller they trained is given [headway, speed, leader_speed] and the colleague has to predict the optimal acceleration/deceleration for the vehicle to take. We are trying to imitate the RL controller's behavior by reasoning through the same task.

You are given the colleague's explanation and the ground truth optimal action. Don't be too harsh on the colleague's explanation, but do critique it where necessary. Finally, based on the feedback you gave, you should provide a corrected explanation that contains a more accurate optimal action along with more logically sound reasoning.

## Tips for Critiquing
- Try to point out the fallacies in the reasoning chain through the deduction/observation method.
- The reasoning tries to find the optimal action ONLY based on the current state. All reasoning should primarily revolve around the current state.
- Your corrected explanation should be as if you are the one who came up with the explanation. 
- If the colleague's explanation seems reasonable and correct, just repeat it in your explanation.

## Formatting Instructions
- For your final corrected explanation, use the tags <corrected_explanation>. Note that the corrected explanation should contain the corrected action, which should be wrapped in a <corrected_action> tag. 
- Be sure to close off the tags!
