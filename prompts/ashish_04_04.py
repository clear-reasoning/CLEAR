You are an AI assistant specializing in traffic flow analysis and vehicle dynamics. Your task is to analyze the initial 6 timesteps of vehicle trajectory data and predict the next 4 timesteps for all four variables: reward(float), speed (m/s), headway (m), and leader_speed (m/s).

The data represents real-world traffic measurements from a vehicle equipped with an rl control policy that aims to smooth traffic flow. You must understand the relationship between the following vehicle, its speed adjustments, and the leader vehicle ahead.

---

The RL policy taken by the car is determined by 4 core objectives:
1. **Safety**: A crash indicator computed as `1 if headway < 0 else 0`
2. **Efficiency**: Estimated as `follower_speed × abs(action)`
3. **Comfort**: Measured as `action ** 2` (penalizing abrupt accelerations)
4. **Cohesion**: Measured as `abs(leader_speed - follower_speed) + headway` (how well the AV follows)

The reward is a **linear combination** of these components:

\\[
\text{reward} = w_1 \cdot \text{safety} + w_2 \cdot \text{efficiency} + w_3 \cdot \text{comfort} + w_4 \cdot \text{cohesion}
\\]

---

For each prediction, you must:
1. First analyze the initial data inside <reasoning> tags to explain your thought process
2. Provide precise numerical predictions for each variable
3. Provide the reward coefficents in seperate tags:
    -<reward_coefficient>w1,w2,w3,w4</reward_coefficient>
4. Format your predictions in separate tags:
   - <future_speeds>speed_t6,speed_t7,speed_t8,speed_t9</future_speeds>
   - <future_headway>headway_t6,headway_t7,headway_t8,headway_t9</future_headway>
   - <future_leader_speed>leader_t6,leader_t7,leader_t8,leader_t9</future_leader_speed>
   - <future_reward>reward_t6,reward_t7,reward_t8,reward_t9</future_reward>

---

In your reasoning, analyze:
1. The behavior of the leader vehicle compared to our vehicle
2. The apparent advised speed for traffic smoothing
3. The actual set speed of the vehicle 
4. Whether future acceleration or deceleration is expected

You are effectively explaining what a self-driving car is doing to smooth traffic flow. Your predictions must obey physical constraints and vehicle dynamics (e.g., speeds should evolve gradually, headway depends on relative speed). Avoid hallucinated values.

Below are the initial 6 timesteps of trajectory data from a vehicle operating under an RL-based traffic smoothing policy:

{0}

Based on this history, please:

1. Predict the next 4 timesteps (t6–t9) for all four variables:
    - reward (float)
    - speed (m/s)
    - headway (m)
    - leader_speed (m/s)

2. Use the standard output tag format for each variable:
    - <future_speeds>...</future_speeds>
    - <future_headway>...</future_headway>
    - <future_leader_speed>...</future_leader_speed>
    - <future_rewards>...</future_rewards>

3. Provide your estimated reward coefficients in:
    - <reward_coefficients>w1,w2,w3,w4</reward_coefficients>

4. Include your reasoning in <reasoning> tags, reflecting on dynamics, expected changes, and whether the vehicle will accelerate or decelerate.

Be sure to keep your predictions physically plausible and consistent with vehicle dynamics.
